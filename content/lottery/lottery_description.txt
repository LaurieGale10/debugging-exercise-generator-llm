Description adapted from https://www.csnewbs.com/python-extended-task-2.

Create a program to simulate a lottery draw.

- First, print "Welcome to the lottery" to the screen.
- Then let the user enter five unique numbers between 1 and 20.
- Next, randomise five numbers between 1 and 20.
- Check to see how many numbers match and output output how many matches a user has, or "You've won the lottery!!" if all five numbers match.

Use pauses to reveal each number one at a time like a real lottery draw.
