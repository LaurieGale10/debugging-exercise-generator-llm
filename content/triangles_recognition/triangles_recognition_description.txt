Description taken from (https://cgi.csc.liv.ac.uk/~frans/CPD/PythonCPD/PythonExampleProblems/Selection/Triangles/triangles2013-3-30.pdf), solution adapted from (https://cgi.csc.liv.ac.uk/~frans/CPD/PythonCPD/PythonExampleProblems/Selection/Triangles/triangles2013-3-30.pdf).

Produce a Python program which, given three sides of a triangle,
determines whether the triangle is:
1. Equilateral (all sides the same length),
2. Isosceles (two sides the same length) or
3. Scalene (no sides the same length).
