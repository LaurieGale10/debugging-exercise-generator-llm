Alex has measured out the dimensions of a cuboid to use for a science experiment. Alex has made a program to calcuate the volume of the cuboid and print it to the screen.

The height and depth of the cuboid are 25cm and its width is 50cm. The volume of a cuboid is calculated using the equation below:

Volume = height x width x depth
