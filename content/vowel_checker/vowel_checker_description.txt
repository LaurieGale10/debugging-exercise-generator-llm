It's literacy week and the Head of English would like you to create a vowel checker program to ensure that year 7s are using plenty of vowels in their work.

- Let the user enter any sentence they like.
- For each letter in the sentence that they have just entered you need to use if statements to check if it is a vowel.
- After the for loop you need to print the number of vowels they have used.
