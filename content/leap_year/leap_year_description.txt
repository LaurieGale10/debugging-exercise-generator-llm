Write a program that inputs a year number and checks if it's a leap year. If it is, print LEAP, otherwise print COMMON.
- A year is a leap year if its number is exactly divisible by 4 and is not exactly divisible by 100.
- A year is always a leap year if its number is exactly divisible by 400.
Note that the words LEAP and COMMON should be printed all caps.
