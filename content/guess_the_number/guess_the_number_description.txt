Create a "guess the number" game for five players. It should work like this:
- Each player chooses a different number between 1 and 100.
- Generate a random number.
- Whoever was furthest from the random number is out of the game.
â€‹- The four remaining players then pick a new number.
This continues with one player being removed each round until only one player is left and they are the winner.
