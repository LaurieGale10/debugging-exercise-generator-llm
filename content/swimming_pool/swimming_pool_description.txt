Develop a Python program which given the width, length and depth in whole metres (thus integer input), of a swimming pool determines and outputs:
(a) the volume in litres
(b) time in hours to fill the swimming pool, calculated by the volume / (rate * 3600)
Assume that the rate of flow into the pool is 2.5 litres per second. Note: 1 litre = 1000 cubic centimetres, therefore 10 litres = 0.01 cubic metre, hence 1 metre = 1000 litres.
