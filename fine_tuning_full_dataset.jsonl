Although novice programmers haven't necessarily been found to forget the inclusion of necessary iteration, this is a subtle enough error to be included in this debugging exercise.\r\n    To add the remaining two syntax errors to the program, since novice programmers commonly confuse assignment (=) and equality (==) operators, the a couple of the equality operators in the conditions of the if statements can be switched.\r\n    In the same way, the first two assignments on lines 2 and 3 can have their assignment operators switched, adding two runtime errors. Novice programmers also commonly mix up similar keywords, so the \"input\" keyword on line 6 can be misspelt, causing a NameError in Python. Finally, an int() cast can be added to line 10, since novice programmers often confuse string and integer types in Python.\r\n    To add the remaining three logical errors, the other two conditions in the if statements can be illogically changed, again using the knowledge that novice programmers often confuse similar symbols with different semantics. Perhaps \"==\" can be changed to \"!=\", erroneously changing the flow of the program. Finally, one of the output statements can be illogically manipulated.
