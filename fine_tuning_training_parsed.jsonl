Even though a ValueError is caught, the int() cast could be removed to introduce a type error (an instance of a runtime error in Python), as novices have difficulties with types and casting.\r\n    To add logical errors, novice programmers often struggle with indenting their programs correctly. Some of the indentation in this program can be manipulated so that certain lines are executed out of order, without introducing any other errors. Additionally, the logic in the if statement can be manipulated to introduce logical errors, as this is something novices struggle with.\r\n    </thinking>\r\n    \r\n    <incorrect-program>\r\n    # Define the secret color and number\r\n    \"blue\" = secret_color\r\n    42 = secret_number\r\n    \r\n    while True\r\n        # Prompt the user to enter 'A' or 'B'\r\n        choice = input(\"Enter 'A' to guess the secret color or 'B' to guess the secret number: \").strip().upper()\r\n        \r\n        if choice = 'B':\r\n            # Let the user guess the secret color\r\n            color_guess == input(\"Guess the secret color: \").strip().lower()\r\n            if color_guess == secret_color:\r\n                print(\"Correct!

Although novice programmers haven't necessarily been found to forget the inclusion of necessary iteration, this is a subtle enough error to be included in this debugging exercise.\r\n    To add the remaining two syntax errors to the program, since novice programmers commonly confuse assignment (=) and equality (==) operators, the a couple of the equality operators in the conditions of the if statements can be switched.\r\n    In the same way, the first two assignments on lines 2 and 3 can have their assignment operators switched, adding two runtime errors. Novice programmers also commonly mix up similar keywords, so the \"input\" keyword on line 6 can be misspelt, causing a NameError in Python. Finally, an int() cast can be added to line 10, since novice programmers often confuse string and integer types in Python.\r\n    To add the remaining three logical errors, the other two conditions in the if statements can be illogically changed, again using the knowledge that novice programmers often confuse similar symbols with different semantics.
