Create a program that asks for a number between 1 and 4. Then use if and elif statements to see what the user has entered and print a statement that displays the chosen number in Spanish. Is the user enters a number above 4, the program should print "That number is not valid".

<correct-program>
number = int(input("Enter a number between 1 and 4: "))

# Check the number and print the corresponding Spanish number
if number == 1:
    print("You entered 1: Uno")
elif number == 2:
    print("You entered 2: Dos")
elif number == 3:
    print("You entered 3: Tres")
elif number == 4:
    print("You entered 4: Cuatro")
else:
    print("That number is not valid.")
