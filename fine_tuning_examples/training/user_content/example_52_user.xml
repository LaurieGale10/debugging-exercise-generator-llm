It is the national hockey championships and you need to write the program for the TV channel showing the live games.

Let the user enter the name of the first country that is playing. Then let the user enter the name of the second country.

If a country's name is over 4 letters long or starts with a "Z", shorten the country's name to its first two letters. Otherwise, shorten the country's name to its first three letters. Print out the team names in uppercase.

<correct-program>
country1 = input("Enter the name of the first country: ")
country2 = input("Enter the name of the second country: ")

country1 = country1.upper()
country2 = country2.upper()

if len(country1) > 4 or country1.startswith('Z'):
    shortened_country1 = country1[:2]
else:
    shortened_country1 = country1[:3]

if len(country2) > 4 or country2.startswith('Z'):
    shortened_country2 = country2[:2]
else:
    shortened_country2 = country2[:3]

print("Team 1: ", shortened_country1)
print("Team 2: ", shortened_country2)
