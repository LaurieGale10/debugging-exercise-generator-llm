<description> 
Create a program using a while loop that keeps asking a user to enter an integer and adds it to a running total. Every time another integer is entered by the user, the program should output the current total.

When the total goes over 100, the program stops and outputs: "OVERLOAD! You have gone over 100!"
</description>
    
<correct-program>
total = 0
while total <= 100:
    number = int(input("Enter a number: "))
    total += number
    print(f"Current total: {total}")
    
print(OVERLOAD! You have gone over 100!)
