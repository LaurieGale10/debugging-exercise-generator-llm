    8 syntax errors is a lot to add, but it is doable in this program. Since there are so many to add, multiple statements can have the same syntax error introduced, making the erroneous program more challenging to debug. Firstly, a few syntax errors can be added by switching the terms in the some of the groups of assignment statements, as novices often believe that the terms are in an assignment are interchangeable. Since novice programmers also commonly mismatch their brackets, the first two input statements can have an additional bracket added to the end. To add the final syntax error, due to novice programmers commonly struggling to correctly format a print statement, one of the print statements can have the ‘f' token moved to a syntactically invalid position.
    Novices often struggle with the notion of types, and sometimes assign values to variables of an incompatible type as a result. In this program, two of the int() casts can be removed, causing type errors when these variables are multiplied with integers.
    Finally, a logical error can be added by removing the reference to the timeToFillPool variable in the final print statement, as the program would no longer be printing what it should.

    printf("Volume in Litres = {timeToFillPool}")
    print(f"Time to fill pool = timeToFillPool")

    Switched the terms of the assignments in lines 1, 2, 3, 10 and 11, so each are syntactically invalid.
    Added an additional closing bracket to end of lines 6 and 7. The int() casts from these two lines were also removed, each adding a runtime error.
    Moved the correctly formatted ‘f' on line 13 to immediately after the print token, adding a syntax error.
    Removed the braces around the timeToFillPool variable reference in line 14, meaning the string "timeToFillPool" is printed rather than its value.
