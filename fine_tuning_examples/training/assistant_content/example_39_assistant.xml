    There are plenty of places to add three errors in this program, so the most subtle errors can be added to make the task a bit more challenging.
    A subtle syntax error could be introduced by incorrectly formatting one of the print statements, since novices often mismatch the symbols used in their print statements. They also struggle with the concept of ensuring function and variable names are identical, so one of the function names could be misspelt  to introduce a runtime error. Finally, one of the functions could simply not be called, meaning part of the program description is not fulfilled.

    <incorrect-program>
    # Define the first subroutine to ask for the user's name
    def ask_name():
        name = input("What is your name? ")
        print("Hello there,"name)
    
    # Define the second subroutine to ask for the user's age
    def ask_age():
        age = input("What is your age? ")
        print(age,"is a good age to be")
    
    # Define the third subroutine to ask for the user's favourite colour
    def ask_favourite_colour():
        colour = input("What is your favourite colour? ")
        print(colour,"is definitely a nice colour")
    
    # Call the subroutines to execute them
    Ask_Name()
    ask_age()
    ask_age()

    <explanation>
    Removed the comma from the print statement in line 4, introducing a syntax error.
    Capitalised the reference to the ask_name() function in line 17, which introduces a runtime error.
    Replaced the call to the ask_favourite_colour() function on line 19 with ask_age(), meaning ask_favourite_colour() never gets called, resulting in a logical error.
