    Two syntax errors can be added by indenting a couple of lines of the programs. Two consecutive lines can be indented to make the errors less subtle, so lines 7 and 8 are good to add.
    It's very difficult to add 7 runtime errors to this program without significantly altering its structure. However, an easy way to add 4 runtime errors is to misspell each reference to the numbers variable, as this is something novice programmers commonly do in their programs. A type error could also be added by assigning the numbers variable to a list rather than a string, especially as novice programmers commonly get different symbols mixed up. This amounts to 5 runtime errors.

    <incorrect-program>
    numbers = "1, 2, 3, 4, 5"
    
    # Print the original list
    print(Numbers)
    
    # Remove the numbers 1 and 3
        Numbers.remove(1)
        Numbers.remove(3)
    
    # Print the list after removal
    print(Numbers)
    </incorrect-program>

    Changed the type of the numbers variable from a list to a string, causing a type error to be thrown at lines 7/8 (if the program is syntactically correct).
    Misspelt the references to the numbers variable to Numbers on lines 4, 7, 8 and 11.
    Incorrectly indented lines 7 and 8.
