    There's plenty of logical errors that could be made here. Novices often get confused with what code is executed after an if statement, so the catch-all else could be removed to introduce a logical error. To make some of the output logically incorrect, some of the translations could be changed to be incorrect too.

    <incorrect-program>
    number = int(input("Enter a number between 1 and 4: "))
    
    # Check the number and print the corresponding Spanish number
    if number <= 1:
        print("You entered 1: Uno")
    elif number == 2:
        print("You entered 2: Deux")
    elif number == 3:
        print("You entered 3: Tres")
    elif number == 4:
        print("You entered 4: Cuatro")
        print("That number is not valid.")

    Line 4: Replaced the equality operator (==) with <=, adding a logical error (prints the incorrect value for when number <= 0).
    Line 7: Changed the output to be French instead of Spanish, adding a logical error.
    Line 12 of original program: Removed the else clause, adding a logical error ("That number is not valid." is erroneously printed if number == 4).
