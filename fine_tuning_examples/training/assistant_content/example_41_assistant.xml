    This program is only a couple of lines long, but it is still possible to add two logical errors. First, the print statement could be encapsulated in quotes, so that the string "ice_cream_flavours" is printed rather than the contents of the variable. Additionally, one of the flavours could be removed from the list, so the contents of the ice_cream_flavours variable could be considered logically incorrect.

    ice_cream_flavors = ["Mint", "Cookie dough"]
    print("ice_cream_flavors")

    Removed the "salted caramel" flavour from the ice_cream_flavours list definition.
    Added quotes to the print statement on line 2 so the ice_cream_flavours is not being printed to the screen.
