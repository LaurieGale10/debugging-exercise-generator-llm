    Two runtime errors can immediately be introduced by removing the float() casts necessary for maintaining correct typing of the program. The function call to math.sqrt() can also be easily manipulated by renaming it in some manner, introducing a runtime error.
    Novices often get similar symbols and operators confused, so the **'s can be changed to *'s. This will add two logical errors without adding any other types of errors. The final output statement could also be changed to reference a logically incorrect variable.

    import math
    
    opposite = input('Input the opposite side of a right angled triangle ')
    adjacent = input('Input the adjacent side of a right angled triangle ')
    
    hypotenuse = math.sqrt((opposite*2)+(adjacent*2))
    print(f'Given:  opposite = {opposite}, adjacent = {adjacent}')
    print(f'Result: hypotenuse = {opposite, adjacent}')

    Removed the float() type casts from lines 3 and 4, both introducing runtime errors.
    Added three errors to line 6: removed the . from the call to the sqrt() function so it reads mathsqrt(), introducing a AttributeError (a type of runtime error).
    Multiplied the opposite and adjacent variables in lines 6 by 2 rather than squaring them, both of which are logical errors.
    Printed the values of the opposite and adjacent variable values rather than the value of the hypotenuse value in the final output statement.
