    The syntax of the first line by can be incorrectly manipulated by conglomerating two of the keywords, input and int, together into one syntactically correct one, as novices programmers have been observed to make this sort of change.
    A type error (an instance of a runtime error in Python) could be added by changing the type of one of the values being assigned to inputInteger.

    <incorrect-program>
    # Input expression
    print('Input an integer')
    inputInteger = intput()
    
    # Make calculation (simple if)
    if (inputInteger<50) :
       inputInteger += "10"
    inputInteger = inputInteger**4.0
    
    # Output
    print("Result is:", inputInteger)
    </incorrect-program>
    
    <error-location>
    3
    7
    </error-location>
    
    <explanation>
    Changed the int(input()) to the syntactically incorrect intput() statement on line 3.
    Converted the value 10 to a string on line 7, introducing a type error due to being unable to increment a variable by a string literal.
