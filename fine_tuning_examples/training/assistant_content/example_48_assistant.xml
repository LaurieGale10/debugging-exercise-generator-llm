    To add syntax errors, since novice programmers often struggle to indent a program correctly, line 3 can be incorrectly indented, as this is the start of a new block of code and hence may be more subtle. Additionally, another bracket can be added to the end of line 5, since novice programmers often incorrectly match the number and type of brackets.
    Two runtime errors can be added by misspelling the calls to the print statements on lines 4 and 8. Additionally, since novice programmers often get assignment (=) and equality (==) mixed up, one of the assignment operators can be replaced with an equality operator.
    Three of the same logical errors can easily be added on line 3. The parameters for each call to the randint() function can be changed so they are logically incorrect. These may be hard for novice programmers to spot, especially since functions are known to be a threshold concept for learners. A final logical error can be added by removing the brackets from the call to the sort() function on line 7. Not including the brackets of a function call is something that novice programmers have been found to do in previous research, which adds a logical error in this case.

    Incorrectly indented line 3.
    Changed each upper bound parameter in the randint() function to be 1000 instead of 100.
    Misspelt calls to the print statements in lines 4 and 8.
    Replaced an assignment operator (=) with an equality operator (==) on line 5, adding a runtime error.
    Also added an extra bracket to the end of line 5.
    Removed the brackets from the sort() function on line 7, adding a logical error.
