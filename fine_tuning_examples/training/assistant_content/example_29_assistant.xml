    Two common novice syntax errors can easily be added to this program. Novice programmers often do not add a colon and at the end of iteration and selection statements, so the colon on line 2 can be removed. They also often do not add quotes to print statements, so the quotes in one of the print statements can be added.
    To add a runtime error, since novice programmers often get confused with types, the int() cast can be removed in line 3, adding a type error (a type of runtime error in Python).

    while total <= 100
        number = input("Enter a number: ")
        total += number
        print(f"Current total: {total}")
        
    print(OVERLOAD! You have gone over 100!)
