    There's not much scope to add a logical error in such a small program, but printing an incorrect output may cause test cases to fail, which constitutes a logical error. Therefore the output of the print statement could be changed.

    <incorrect-program>
    print("greetings land")
    </incorrect-program>

    Changed the print statement's parameter to be "greetings land" instead of "Hello world". As a result, the program does not output what is specified and hence introduces a logical error.
