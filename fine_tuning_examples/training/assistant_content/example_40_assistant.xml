    There are a couple of places where three very similar runtime errors can be added to the program. One of these is by changing the names of the three function calls to be misspelt. Introductory programming students often don't correctly spell function names and symbols, so these errors are appropriate for this exercise, and hard to spot.

    <incorrect-program>
    # Define the first subroutine to ask for the user's name
    def ask_name():
        name = input("What is your name? ")
        print("Hello there,",name)
    
    # Define the second subroutine to ask for the user's age
    def ask_age():
        age = input("What is your age? ")
        print(age,"is a good age to be")
    
    # Define the third subroutine to ask for the user's favourite colour
    def ask_favourite_colour():
        colour = input("What is your favourite colour? ")
        print(colour,"is definitely a nice colour")
    
    # Call the subroutines to execute them
    ask_Name()
    ask_Age()
    ask_Favourite_colour()
    </incorrect-program>

    Changed the spelling of all of the function calls in lines 17,18 and 19. Each of these adds a NameError (a type of runtime error).
