    4 logical errors seems close to the upper limit of logical errors that could be added without significantly altering the program's structure and semantics. Regardless, two errors can easily be added by replacing the call to the remove() function with a different function. Novice programmers sometimes struggle with correctly implementing function calls so this seems appropriate. To add some more, the numbers variable could be incorrectly initialised, for example, by decreasing all of the values by one. The final print statement could also print some property of the numbers list rather than the list itself; length is a good example. While these last two aren't necessarily common novice programming errors that research has found, they would still be likely challenging for novices to debug.

    <incorrect-program>
    numbers = [0, 1, 2, 3, 4]
    
    # Print the original list
    print(numbers)
    
    # Remove the numbers 1 and 3
    numbers.append(1)
    numbers.append(3)
    
    # Print the list after removal
    print(len(numbers))
    </incorrect-program>
    
    <error-location>
    1
    7
    8
    11
    </error-location>

    Incorrectly initialised the numbers list in line 1 so it contains numbers 0-4 instead of 1-5.
    Replaced the remove() function calls with append() in lines 7 and 8.
    Printed the length of the numbers list rather than the actual numbers list.
