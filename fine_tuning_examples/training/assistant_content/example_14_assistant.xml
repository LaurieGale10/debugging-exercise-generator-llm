    Novices often get assignment (=) and equality (==) operators confused, a runtime could be added by replacing an assignment with a comparison operator.
    Novices also sometimes forget to use quotes where required, these could be removed from the Budapest in the if statement condition which will introduce a NameError in Python (a type of runtime error).

        print("Correct!")
    else:
        print("Incorrect. The correct answer is Budapest.")

    Line 1: Replaced the assignment operator (=) with an equality operator (==), adding a NameError (an instance of a runtime error in Python).
    Line 7: Removed the quotes surrounding "budapest" in the if statement condition, introducing a NameError (an instance of a runtime error in Python).
