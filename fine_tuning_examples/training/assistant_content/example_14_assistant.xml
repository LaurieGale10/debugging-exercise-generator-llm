    Novices often get assignment (=) and equality (==) operators confused, a runtime could be added by replacing an assignment with a comparison operator.
    Novices also sometimes forget to use quotes where required, these could be removed from the Budapest in the if statement condition which will introduce a NameError in Python (a type of runtime error).

    user_answer == input("What is the capital of Hungary? ")

    print(f"You answered: {user_answer}")
    
    # Check if the answer is correct and display the appropriate message
    if user_answer.strip().lower() == budapest:
        print("Correct!")
    else:
        print("Incorrect. The correct answer is Budapest.")

    Replaced the assignment operator (=) with an equality operator (==).
    Removed the quotes surrounding "Budapest" in the if statement condition, introducing a NameError in Python.
