    Due to the program being over 30 lines long, there's quite a lot of scope to add different errors. Two logical errors of similar nature can be added that they don't "stand out". Since novice programmers typically get similar-looking operators confused with each other, two of the equality operators (==), such as the ones used to check the user's input against the secret colour/number, can be changed with a different symbol. The inequality operator (!=) seems appropriate as it causes a logical error without adding other types of errors.

    # Define the secret color and number

        choice = input("Enter 'A' to guess the secret color or 'B' to guess the secret number: ").strip().upper()
        
        if choice == 'A':
            # Let the user guess the secret color
            color_guess = input("Guess the secret color: ").strip().lower()
            if color_guess != secret_color:

            except ValueError:
                print("Please enter a valid number.")
        
        else:
            # If the user presses any other key, repeat the loop
            print("Invalid choice. Please enter 'A' or 'B'.")

    <explanation>
    Replaced the equality operators (==) on lines 12 and 22 with inequality operators (==), meaning the program will output "Correct" whenever they guess incorrectly.
