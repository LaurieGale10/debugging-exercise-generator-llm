    It's difficult to add 17 errors to this program without significantly changing the structure of it, so instead four logical and four runtime errors seems like an appropriate number to add. Novice programmers often incorrectly use similarly spelled keywords, so the input() function calls on lines 1 and 2 can be changed to "intput", as int is a regularly used type in Python. Similarly, one of the variable references can be subtly misspelt to add another runtime error; perhaps shortened_country1 on line 15. Finally, novice programmers often confuse assignment operators (=) and equality operators (==), which cab be exploited to add a runtime error in one of the assignment statements.
    For the logical errors to add, novice programmers often find logical operators confusing to understand. Since lines 7 and 12 of the correct program use "or" operators, these can be replaced with "and" operators to add two logical errors. For the final two logical errors, lines 4 and 5 can be removed, which convert the country strings to upper case. Although this isn't something research has found novice programmers to specifically struggle with, they are subtle errors that will be challenging for secondary school students to debug.

    It's difficult to add 17 errors to this program without significantly changing the structure of it, so four runtime and four logical errors were added instead.
    Misspelt the calls to the input() function on lines 1 and 2 to "intput", each adding NameError's (instances of runtime errors in Python).
    Removed lines 4 and 5 of the original program which converted the country names to upper case, each adding a logical error.
    Replaced the or logical operator with and on lines 5 and 10, each adding logical errors.
    Replaced the assignment operator (=) with the equality operator (==) on line 5, adding a runtime error.
    Mispelt the reference to the shortened_country1 variable on line 15, adding a runtime error.
