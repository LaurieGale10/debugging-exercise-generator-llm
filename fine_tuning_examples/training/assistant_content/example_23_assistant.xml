    Novices often struggle with the syntax of if statements, so a couple of syntax errors could be added in relation to this. Since novices also commonly mismatch brackets, one of the sets of brackets in the if statement could be unbalanced in one of the input statements.
    To add two runtime errors, the float() casts can be changed to a different type cast that would introduce a type error (a type of runtime error in Python), such as str().
    To add logical errors, the program could be refactored to check for the incorrect total. References to 9000 in the if statement condition and resulting print statement could be subtly changed to 900.

    <incorrect-program>
    number1 = str(input("Enter the first number: "))
    number2 = str(input("Enter the second number: ")))
    
    total = number1 * number2
    if total > 900;
        print("It's over 900!!!")
    else;
        print("Unfortunately the number is not over 9000.")
    
    </incorrect-program>

    Changed the float() casts in lines 1 and 2 to str() casts, each adding type errors (type of runtime errors). Also added an extra closing bracket at the end of line 2.
    Replaced the colons at the end of lines 5 and 7 with semi-colons, both adding syntax errors.
    Changed the first two references to the number 9,000 in lines 5 and 6 with references to 900, both adding their own individual logical errors.
