    Novices often struggle with the syntax of if statements, so a couple of syntax errors could be added in relation to this. Since novices also commonly mismatch brackets, one of the sets of brackets in the if statement could be unbalanced in one of the input statements.
    To add two runtime errors, the float() casts can be changed to a different type cast that would introduce a type error (a type of runtime error in Python), such as str().
    To add logical errors, the program could be refactored to check for the incorrect total. References to 9000 in the if statement condition and resulting print statement could be subtly changed to 900.

    <incorrect-program>
    number1 = str(input("Enter the first number: "))
    number2 = str(input("Enter the second number: ")))
    
    total = number1 * number2
    if total > 900;
        print("It's over 900!!!")
    else;
        print("Unfortunately the number is not over 9000.")
    
    </incorrect-program>

    Line 1: Changed the float() cast for the number1 assignment to a str() cast, adding a TypeError (an instance of a runtime error in Python).
    Line 2: Changed the float() cast for the number2 assignment to a str() cast, adding a TypeError (an instance of a runtime error in Python).
    Line 2: Added an extra closing bracket at the end of the line, adding a syntax error.
    Line 5: Replaced the colons at the end of the line with a semi-colon, adding a syntax error.
    Line 5: Changed the 9000 to 900 in the if statement condition, adding a logical error.
    Line 6: Changed the 9000 to 900 in the print statement, adding a logical error.
