    Functions are difficult concepts for novices to grasp, so some syntax errors can be inserted there. The call to the function could have an unnecessary symbol added to it. Also, coupled with the fact that novice programmers often have incorrect indentation in Python programs, the last statement of the function could be unindented to add confusion. Novices also occasionally have incomplete statements, so one of the assignments could be incomplete. Finally, novices often have trouble correctly formatting print statements, so a couple of the symbols could be switched around in a syntactically incorrect manner.

    newCharacter = convert_to_uppercase(lowercaseCharacter,)

    Line 3: Removed the assignment operator (=) from the assignment, adding a syntax error.
    Line 5: Unindented this line, adding a syntax error.
    Line 8: Added a comma in the call to the convert convert_to_uppercase() function #TODO: This doesn't add a syntax error.
    Line 9: Switched around the " and + symbols after the "Lower case" string, adding a syntax error as the print statement is no longer correctly formatted.
