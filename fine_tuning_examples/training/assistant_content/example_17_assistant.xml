    Functions are difficult concepts for novices to grasp, so some syntax errors can be inserted there. The call to the function could have an unnecessary symbol added to it. Also, coupled with the fact that novice programmers often have incorrect indentation in Python programs, the last statement of the function could be unindented to add confusion. Novices also occasionally have incomplete statements, so one of the assignments could be incomplete. Finally, novices often have trouble correctly formatting print statements, so a couple of the symbols could be switched around in a syntactically incorrect manner.

    def convert_to_uppercase(lowercase):
        asciiValue = ord(lowercase)
        newAsciiValue asciiValue - 32 
        newCharacter = chr(newAsciiValue)
    return newCharacter
    
    lowercaseCharacter = input('Enter lowercase character: ')
    newCharacter = convert_to_uppercase(lowercaseCharacter,)
    print("Lower case +" lowercaseCharacter+" -> upper case "+newCharacter)

    <explanation>
    Removed the assignment operator (=) from the assignment on line 3. 
    Unindented the return statement of the convert_to_uppercase() function
    Added a comma in the call to the convert convert_to_uppercase() function
    Switched around the " and + after the "Lower case" output in the final print statement, so that the print statement is not correctly formatted.
