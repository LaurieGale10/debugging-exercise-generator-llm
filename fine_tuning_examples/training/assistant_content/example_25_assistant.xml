    Since novices often struggle with implementing print statements with correct syntax in Python, the quotes from each print statement could be removed to add two syntax errors.
    Lots of runtime errors need to be added. Since novices get the assignment operator (=) and the equality operator (==) commonly confused, both assignments could be replaced with an equality operator. Additionally, a couple of the variable references could be manipulated in such a way to introduce different types of runtime errors in Python.
    A logical error can be added by changing the condition of the if statement, so as novices sometimes get comparator operators mixed up.

    <incorrect-program>
    number1 == float(input("Enter the first number: "))
    number1 == float(input("Enter the second number: "))
    
    total = number1 * number2
    if Total >= 9000:
        print(It's over 9,000!!!)
    else:
        print(Unfortunately the number is not over 9000.)

    Converted the assignment operators (=) in lines 1 and 2 to equality operators (==).
    Changed the assignment of number2 to number1 in line 2, introducing a runtime error when number2 is referred to in line 5.
    Capitalised the reference to the total variable on line 5, introducing a runtime error. Also replaced the greater than comparator with greater than or equals to, which makes the if statement condition logically incorrect.
    Removed the quotations from the print statements in lines 6 and 8, both adding syntax errors.
