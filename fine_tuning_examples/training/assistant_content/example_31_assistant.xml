    Two logical errors can easily be added into the program by subtly removing two symbols which novices are often confused by. Firstly, the <= inequality on line 2 can be changed to <. This adds a logical error without violating Python syntax or semantics. In a similar vein, the += on line 4 can be changed to =, meaning the total variable no longer collects the total value.

    <incorrect-program>
    total = 0
    while total < 100:
        number = int(input("Enter a number: "))
        total = number
        print(f"Current total: {total}")
        
    print("OVERLOAD! You have gone over 100!")
    </incorrect-program>
    
    <error-location>
    2
    4
    </error-location>

    Line 2: Replaced the less than or equal inequality (<=) with the less than inequality (<) on line 2, adding a logical error (logically incorrect for the edge case of total = 100).
    Line 4: Replaced the addition assignment operator (+=) with the assignment operator (=) on line 4, adding a logical operator.
