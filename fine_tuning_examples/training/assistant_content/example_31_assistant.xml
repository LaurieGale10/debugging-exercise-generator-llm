    Two logical errors can easily be added into the program by subtly removing two symbols which novices are often confused by. Firstly, the <= inequality on line 2 can be changed to <. This adds a logical error without violating Python syntax or semantics. In a similar vein, the += on line 4 can be changed to =, meaning the total variable no longer collects the total value.

    <incorrect-program>
    total = 0
    while total < 100:
        number = int(input("Enter a number: "))
        total = number
        print(f"Current total: {total}")
        
    print("OVERLOAD! You have gone over 100!")
    </incorrect-program>
    
    <error-location>
    2
    4
    </error-location>
    
    <explanation>
    Replaced the <= inequality with < on line 2, making the program logically incorrect for the edge case of total = 100.
    Replaced the += with = on line 4, meaning the running total is no longer collected. Instead, the total variable only holds the user's most recently inputted value.
