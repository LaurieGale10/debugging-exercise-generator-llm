    It's difficult to add 10 syntax error to such a short program without significantly altering its structure, so let's limit this to three. First, research has found that introductory programmers struggle with correctly formatting print statements and assignments to be of the correct syntax. A syntax error can be added with respect to each of these constructs; the expressions on each side of the assignment can be switched, and the brackets can be removed for the print statement. Another syntax error can be added by removing one of the commas from the list in line 1.
    A runtime error can be added by replacing the assignment operator (=) with an equality operator (==) in line 1.
    Given these errors have been added, it's hard to add two logical errors without significantly changing the state of the program. One, however, can be added by changing one of the items in the list, so the output on line 2 is not correct.

    It's difficult to add 10 syntax errors to this program without significantly altering it's structure, so only three were added.
    Switched the expressions on each side of the assignment, making the assignment syntactically invalid.
    Removed one of the commas in the definition of the list in line 1.
    Changed one of the flavour names in the ice_cream_flavours list, meaning the list's contents violate the exercise description.
    Replaced the assignment operator (=) with the equality operator (==) in line 1, causing a NameError (a type of RuntimeError in Python).
    Removed the brackets from the print statement in line 2.
