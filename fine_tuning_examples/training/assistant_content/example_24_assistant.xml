    Two runtime errors could be easily be added by changing the two variable references in line 4, such that they are misspelt and no longer refer to the variables in question.
    A single logical error could be added by changing the multiplication operator (*) to something else when calculating and assigning the total variable. Novice programmers sometimes confuse operators, especially those that not seen in traditional mathematics education, so this seems like a suitable change.

    <incorrect-program>
    number1 = float(input("Enter the first number: "))
    number2 = float(input("Enter the second number: "))
    
    total = number_1 + number_2
    if total > 9000:
        print("It's over 9,000!!!")
    else:
        print("Unfortunately the number is not over 9000.")
    </incorrect-program>

    All of the errors have been added to line 4 in this example. Firstly, the two runtime errors were added by adding an underscore to the number1 and number2 references, each adding a separate runtime error. The logical error was added by replacing the multiplication operator (*) with the add operator (+), meaning the program description is not followed.
