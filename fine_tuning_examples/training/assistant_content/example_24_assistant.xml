    Two runtime errors could be easily be added by changing the two variable references in line 4, such that they are misspelt and no longer refer to the variables in question.
    A single logical error could be added by changing the multiplication operator (*) to something else when calculating and assigning the total variable. Novice programmers sometimes confuse operators, especially those that not seen in traditional mathematics education, so this seems like a suitable change.

    <incorrect-program>
    number1 = float(input("Enter the first number: "))
    number2 = float(input("Enter the second number: "))
    
    total = number_1 + number_2
    if total > 9000:
        print("It's over 9,000!!!")
    else:
        print("Unfortunately the number is not over 9000.")
    </incorrect-program>

    Line 4: Added an underscore to the number_1 variable so that it no longer refers to a variable in the program, adding a NameError (an instance of a runtime error).
    Line 4: Added an underscore to the number_2 variable so that it no longer refers to a variable in the program, adding a NameError (an instance of a runtime error).
    Line 4: Replaced the multiplication operator (*) with an addition operator (+), adding a logical error.
