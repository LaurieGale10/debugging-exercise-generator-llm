    This program contains several Python functions. Novices often struggle with correctly formatting the syntax of function calls and definitions, so the one of the syntax errors can be to do with this. Removing the brackets from one of the function calls is a typical novice mistake and introduces a type of runtime error in Python. One of the print statement's syntax can also be incorrectly manipulated, adding a syntax error. This is something novices typically get confused with too.
    The remaining two runtime errors can easily be added through replacing equality operators (=) with assignment operators (==), which add NameErrors in Python (types of runtime errors). 
    Some logical errors can be added by removing necessary lines of code. One of the function calls and one of the print statements can be removed. Novice programmers also struggle with correctly formatting print statements, so one of these can be incorrectly formatted to no longer output a necessary variable. Finally, one of the variables can be assigned to a logically incorrect variable.

    Line 3: Replaced the assignment operator (=) with the inequality operator (==) in the assignment, introducing a NameError (an instance of a runtime error in Python) in this case.
    Line 4: Printed "age" instead of the value of the age variable, introducing a logical error.
    Line 8: Replaced the assignment operator (=) with the inequality operator (==) in the assignment, introducing a NameError (an instance of a runtime error in Python) in this case.
    Line 8: Removed the call to the input() function so the age variable is assigned to a string literal, adding a syntax error.
    Line 9: Removed the comma from the print statement, adding a syntax error.
    Line 12: Removed the brackets and colon from the function definition, adding a syntax error.
    Line 14 of original program: Removed this print statement necessary to fulfill the problem description, adding a logical error.
    Line 18 of original program: Removed this function call so that ask_age is never called, adding a logical error.
    Line 18: Removed the brackets from function call on line 17, adding a runtime error. #TODO; Change - this doesn't add a runtime error.
