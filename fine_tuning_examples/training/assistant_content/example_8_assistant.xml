    Novices sometimes incorrectly capitalise variable names, so one of the references to inputInteger could be misspelt. Novices often incorrectly type variables in python, so the necessary int() cast on line 3 could be removed to introduce a type error (a type of runtime error in Python). To add the remaining runtime error, one of the assignments in the programming could have its assignment operator (=) replaced with a comparison operator (==)

    <incorrect-program>
    # Input expression
    print('Input an integer')
    inputInteger = input()
    
    # Make calculation (simple if)
    if (InputInteger<50) :
       inputInteger += 10
    inputInteger == inputInteger**4.0
    
    # Output
    print("Result is:", inputInteger)

    Removed the int() cast for the inputInteger variable on line 3, which adds a type error (an instance of runtime error in Python).
    Incorrectly renamed one of the references to the inputInteger variable on line 6 to InputInteger, which adds a NameError (an instance of a runtime error in Python).
    Replaced the assignment operator (=) in line 8 with an equality operator (==) to introduce another NameError (runtime error).
