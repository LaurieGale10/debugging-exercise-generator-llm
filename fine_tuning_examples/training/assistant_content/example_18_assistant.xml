    There's lots of places to add a syntax error, but because novices often get similar-looking keywords mixed up, the input keyword could be misspelt to include "int".
    Novices are also not always consistent with referencing their variables, sometimes not spelling the variable reference exactly. As a result, the names of some of the variable references could be changed to add some runtime errors.
    To add logical errors, I could add some incorrect logic around the function call. Novices tend to struggle with the idea of calling a function,  so the call to the convert_to_uppercase() function could be replaced with a different function. Within the function there are also calls to built-in Python functions. One of these could be changed to something that edits the logic of the program. Finally, the print statement could be formatted differently by switching the two variable references. This would only introduce a logical error: the string would not print the correct output.

    def convert_to_uppercase(lowercase):
        asciiValue = ord(lowercase)
        newAsciiValue = AsciiValue-32
        newCharacter = str(newAsciiValue)
        return newCharacter
    
    lowercaseCharacter = intput('Enter lowercase character: ')
    newCharacter = str(lowercaseCharacter)
    print("Lower case "+ newCharacter +" -> upper case "+ lowerCaseCharacter)

    Line 3: Changed the spelling of the reference to the asciiValue variable to AsciiValue. This means it is no longer referencing a variable, introducing a NameError (an instance of a runtime error in Python).
    Line 4: Replaced the chr() function call with str(), adding a logical error. This is because the ASCII value is assigned to newCharacter rather than the ASCII value's equivalent character.
    Line 7: Changed the spelling of the input() function call to the misspelt "intput" so that it longer refers to a valid function, adding a NameError (an instance of a runtime error in Python).
    Line 8: Replaced the convert_to_uppercase() function call with a call to the str() function, introducing a logical error.
    Line 9: Switched the references to the newCharacter and lowercaseCharacter variables within the print statement so the program's output is not correct, adding a logical error.
    Line 9: Renamed the lowercaseCharacter variable reference to lowerCaseCharacter, adding a NameError (an instance of a runtime error in Python).
