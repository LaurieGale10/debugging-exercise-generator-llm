    Two syntax errors related to common introductory programmer errors can easily be added to this program. First of all, novice programmers often mismatch similar symbols such as brackets, so the square brackets can be changed to not correctly match. Novice programmers also struggle with correctly indenting Python programs, so the second line of the program can be incorrectly indented.
    To add a runtime error, the first reference to the ice_cream_flavours on line 2 could be misspelt, which throws a runtime error in Python.

    <incorrect-program>
    ice_cream_flavours = ["Salted caramel", "Mint", "Cookie dough")
        print(ice_cream_flavors)
    </incorrect-program>
    
    <error-location>

    2
    2
    </error-location>

    Line 1: Mismatched the list brackets, adding a syntax error.
    Line 2: Incorrectly indented this line, adding a syntax error.
    Line 2: Mispelled the reference to the ice_cream_flavours variable so that it no longer refers to a valid variable, adding a NameError (an instance of a runtime error in Python).
