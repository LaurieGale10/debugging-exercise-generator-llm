    To add syntax errors that novice programmers often make, some quotes from a print statement can be removed. Some syntactically invalid whitespace could also be added.
    To add some runtime errors, since novice programmers get mixed up with the use of keywords, and "int" and "input" are very similar, one of these keywords could be removed on line 1. Novice programmers also get confused between the assignment operator (=) and the equality operator (==), so these can be incorrectly interchanged in line 1.
    A logical error could be added removing the final else condition so that the final print statement in the program always gets printed. The programmer would then have to deduce that they'd need to add an else. One of the output statements could also be slightly adjusted to add a logical error.

    number == int("Enter a number between 1 and 4: ")
    
    # Check the number and print the corresponding Spanish number
    if number == 1:
        print(You entered 1: Uno)
    elif number == 2:
        print("You entered 2: Dos")
    elif number == 3:
             print("You entered 3: Tres")
    elif number == 4:
        print("You entered 3: Cuatro")
    print("That number is not valid.")

    Line 1: Removed the input statement originally on this line, adding a ValueError (an instance of a runtime error in Python).
    Line 1: Replaced the assignment operator (=) with an equality operator (==) in the assignment, adding a NameError (an instance of a runtime error in Python).
    Line 5: Removed the quotes from the print statement, adding a syntax error.
    Line 9: Added syntactically invalid indentation in the body of the elif clause, adding a syntax error.
    Line 11: Slightly adjusted the output on this line so that it reads "You entered 3" instead of "You entered 4", adding a logical error.
    Line 12: Removed the else clause in the original program and unindented the body of it (line 12 of the incorrect program) so that "That number is not valid" is always printed, adding a logical error.
