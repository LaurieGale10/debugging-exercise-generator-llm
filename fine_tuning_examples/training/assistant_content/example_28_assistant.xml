    There are lots of places to add a runtime error in this program. One common mistake that novice programmers make is declaring a variable before being assigned, which introduces a NameError in Python (a type of runtime error). The first three variables could be declared before their assignment, as just doing this for one variable might be a bit too simple to debug.

    volumeOfPoolInLitres = lengthOfPool * widthOfPool * depthOfPool * METRES_2_LITRES
    timeToFillPool = (volumeOfPoolInLitres/RATE_OF_FLOW) * SECONDS_2_HOURS
    
    print(f"Volume in Litres = {timeToFillPool}")
    print(f"Time to fill pool = {timeToFillPool}")

    <explanation>
    Added an initial line that declares the variables RATE_OF_FLOW, METRES_2_LITRES,SECONDS_2_HOURS without assigning them to any value.
