    To make the logic of the program incorrect in a way that is consistent with common novice programming mistakes, the condition of the if statement could be adjusted to use different inequalities, as well as move some of the code within the if statement to outside of it.

    <incorrect-program>
    age = int(input("Enter your age: "))
    
    # Check if the user is old enough to vote
    if age > 18:
        print("You are old enough to vote!")
    else:
        print("You are not old enough to vote yet.")
    print("You are not old enough to vote yet.")
    </incorrect-program>
    
    <error-location>
    4
    8
    </error-location>
    
    <explanation>
    Line 4: Adjusted the >= inequality in the condition of the if statement to be >, adding a logical error (the program's output will be incorrect when the user inputs 18).
    Line 8: Duplicated the statement on line 7 to be outside of the if statement too, adding a logical error (this statement will be erroneously printed even when the user is able to vote).
