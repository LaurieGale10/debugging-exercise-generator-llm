    There are lots of small syntactical errors that novices usually make when programming, including forgetting to include single character symbols when necessary. So a pair of brackets could be removed from a print statement, and the colon from the if statement could also be removed to introduce some syntax errors.

    <incorrect-program>
    age = int(input("Enter your age: "))
    
    # Check if the user is old enough to vote
    if age => 18
        print("You are old enough to vote!")
    else:
        print "You are not old enough to vote yet."
    </incorrect-program>

    Changed the inequality in the condition of the if statement to be => instead of >=, adding a syntax error.
    Removed the colon at the end of line 4, adding a syntax error.
    Removed the brackets from the print statement on line 7.
