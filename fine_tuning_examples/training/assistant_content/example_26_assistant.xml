    Novices often get confused with the syntax of assignment, so a component of the first group of assignments could be manipulated to be erroneous. Perhaps the first two assignments could be merged onto the same line in a syntactically incorrect manner.

    RATE_OF_FLOW  = 2.5, METRES_2_LITRES = 1000.0
    SECONDS_2_HOURS = 1.0/3600.0
        
    # Input 
    lengthOfPool = int(input("Enter length of pool: "))
    widthOfPool  = int(input("Enter width of pool: "))
    depthOfPool  = int(input("Enter depth of pool: "))
    
    volumeOfPoolInLitres = lengthOfPool * widthOfPool * depthOfPool * METRES_2_LITRES
    timeToFillPool = (volumeOfPoolInLitres/RATE_OF_FLOW) * SECONDS_2_HOURS
    
    print(f"Volume in Litres = {timeToFillPool}")
    print(f"Time to fill pool = {timeToFillPool}")

    Line 1: Merged the first two assignments on lines 1 and 2 of the original program onto the same line with incorrect syntax, adding a syntax error.
