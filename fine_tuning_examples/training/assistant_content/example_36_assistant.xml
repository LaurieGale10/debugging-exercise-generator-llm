    13 errors are a lot to add, but this program is large enough to add all of them.
    There are plenty of syntax errors that could be added. Based on the fact that novice programmers often incorrectly format assignment statements, sets of brackets, sets of symbols, and indentation, the first two assignment statements could be mutated.
    Since this program is in Python, similar changes could be introduced some runtime errors. The assignment operator (=) could be switched with equality operators (==) in some lines. Even though a ValueError is caught, the int() cast could be removed to introduce a type error (an instance of a runtime error in Python), as novices have difficulties with types and casting.
    To add logical errors, novice programmers often struggle with indenting their programs correctly. Some of the indentation in this program can be manipulated so that certain lines are executed out of order, without introducing any other errors. Additionally, the logic in the if statement can be manipulated to introduce logical errors, as this is something novices struggle with.

    Switched the terms in the first two assignments on lines 2 and 3, both introducing syntax errors.
    Removed the colon at the end of line 5.
    Replaced the equality operators (==) with assignment operators (=) in lines 9 and 18, each introducing syntax errors.
    Removed the brackets from the print statements in line 33.
    Switched the right-hand side of the comparisons in the if statement conditions in lines 9 and 18. The code for when A is inputted is now executed when B is inputted, and vice versa.
    Indented line 33 so it's executed after each iteration of the while loop, rather than at the end.
