    13 errors are a lot to add, but this program is large enough to add all of them.
    There are plenty of syntax errors that could be added. Based on the fact that novice programmers often incorrectly format assignment statements, sets of brackets, sets of symbols, and indentation, the first two assignment statements could be mutated.
    Since this program is in Python, similar changes could be introduced some runtime errors. The assignment operator (=) could be switched with equality operators (==) in some lines. Even though a ValueError is caught, the int() cast could be removed to introduce a type error (an instance of a runtime error in Python), as novices have difficulties with types and casting.
    To add logical errors, novice programmers often struggle with indenting their programs correctly. Some of the indentation in this program can be manipulated so that certain lines are executed out of order, without introducing any other errors. Additionally, the logic in the if statement can be manipulated to introduce logical errors, as this is something novices struggle with.

    Line 2: Switched the terms around in the assignment, adding a syntax error.
    Line 3: Switched the terms around in the assignment, adding a syntax error.
    Line 5: Removed the colon at the end of the while loop, adding a syntax error.
    Line 9: Replaced the equality operators (==) with an assignment operator (=) in the condition of the if statement, adding a syntax error.
    Line 9: Changed the right-hand side of the if statement condition from "A" to "B", adding a logical error.
    Line 11: Replaced the assignment operator (=) with the inequality operator (==) in the assignment, introducing a NameError (an instance of a runtime error in Python) in this case.

    Line 21: Removed the int() cast from the right-hand side of the assignment, adding a TypeError (an instance of a runtime error in Python).
    Line 33: Removed the brackets from the print statement, adding a syntax error.
    Line 33: Indented this line so it's executed within each each iteration of the while loop rather than at the end of the program, adding a logical error.
