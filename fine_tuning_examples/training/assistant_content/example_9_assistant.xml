    Novices sometimes certain symbols confused, some mismatching quotes and brackets could be added to some of the statements to add syntax errors. Novice programmers also struggle with indentation so this could be added on lines that are currently indented correctly.
    
    To add logical errors, the ** operator could be changed to *. This is a subtle change but means the inputInteger is multipled by 4 rather than raised to the power of 4. Since novices usually put quotes in incorrect places, the last print statement could be changed to print the string "inputInteger" rather than print its value.

    # Input expression
    print('Input an integer")
    inputInteger = int(input(())
    
    # Make calculation (simple if)
    if (inputInteger<50) :
             inputInteger += 10
    inputInteger = inputInteger*4.0
    
    # Output
    print("Result is: inputInteger")

    Line 1: Changed the opening quotation mark inside the print statement so the quotations are mismatched, adding a syntax error.
    Line 3: Added an extra bracket to the input statement, adding a syntax error.
    Line 7: Added some extra indentation to the line, adding a syntax error.
    Line 8: Changed the ** operator to *, adding a logical error (inputInteger is multiplied by 4.0 rather than raised to the power of 4).
    Line 11: Changed the formatting of the print statement, adding a logical error (the literal string "Result is: inputInteger" is printed instead of the value of the inputInteger variable).
