    Indentation is something that novices commonly get wrong, so some necessary indentation in the if statement can be removed.
    To add runtime errors, the assignment operator (=) in the first assignment can be changed to an equality operator. One of the references to the age variable can also be misspelt.
    The logical error can be added by changing the comparison in the if statement, so that it incorrectly states anyone over 18 is allowed to vote (rather than 18 or over).

    <incorrect-program>
    age == int(input("Enter your age: "))
    
    # Check if the user is old enough to vote
    if age_input > 18:
        print("You are old enough to vote!")
    else:
    print("You are not old enough to vote yet.")
    </incorrect-program>

    Replaced the assignment operator (=) with the equality operator on line 1, adding a runtime error.
    Changed the age variable reference on line 4 to a non-existent age_input, adding a runtime error.
    Added a logical adding by replacing the >= inequality with a > on line 4.
    Removed the necessary indentation to line 7, adding a syntax error.
