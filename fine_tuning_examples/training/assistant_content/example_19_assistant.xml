    The program currently has no error handling, so some error handling with incorrect logic could be added. Lots of novice programmers struggle with concept of returning in a function, so the function could return something logically incorrect. One of the values could also be misassigned within the convert_to_uppercase() function, encouraging students to test and debug the program.

    def convert_to_uppercase(lowercase):
        if lowercase < 97 and lowercase > 122:
           return "You did not input a lowercase letter"
        else:
            asciiValue = ord(lowercase)
            newAsciiValue = asciiValue + 32
            newCharacter = chr(newAsciiValue)
            return newAsciiValue
    
    lowercaseCharacter = input('Enter lowercase character: ')
    newCharacter = convert_to_uppercase(lowercaseCharacter)

    Line 2: Added logically incorrect error handling for inputs that are not lowercase letters; the "and" should instead be an "or", adding a logical error.
    Line 6: Incorrectly assigned the newAsciiValue variable to asciiValue + 32 instead of asciiValue â€“ 32, adding a logical error.
    Line 8: Returned the newAsciiValue variable instead of the newCharacter variable, adding a logical error.
