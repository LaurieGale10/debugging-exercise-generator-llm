    The program currently has no error handling, so some error handling with incorrect logic could be added. Lots of novice programmers struggle with concept of returning in a function, so the function could return something logically incorrect. One of the values could also be misassigned within the convert_to_uppercase() function, encouraging students to test and debug the program.

    <incorrect-program>
    def convert_to_uppercase(lowercase):
        if lowercase < 97 and lowercase > 122:
           return "You did not input a lowercase letter"
        else:
            asciiValue = ord(lowercase)
            newAsciiValue = asciiValue + 32
            newCharacter = chr(newAsciiValue)
            return newAsciiValue
    
    lowercaseCharacter = input('Enter lowercase character: ')
    newCharacter = convert_to_uppercase(lowercaseCharacter)
    </incorrect-program>

    <explanation>
    Added logically incorrect error handling for inputs that are not lowercase letters; the "and" should instead be an "or"
    Incorrectly assigned the newAsciiValue variable to asciiValue + 32 instead of asciiValue – 32
    Returned the newAsciiValue variable instead of the newCharacter variable.
