    Novice programmers typically incorrectly indent their program, so one of the lines immediately after one of the while loops could be unindented. These seem like the least obvious lines to indent.
    Two similar logical errors could be added by changing the parameters of the range function, as novice programmers often iterate across the loop an incorrect number of times.

    <incorrect-program>
    for i in range(5):
    print(i)
    print("Once I caught a fish alive")
    for i in range(10):
        print(i)
    print("Then I let it go again")
    </incorrect-program>
    
    <error-location>

    2
    4
    </error-location>

    Line 1: Changed the range in the for loop from (1,6) to (5), adding a logical error.
    Line 2: Unindented this line, adding a syntax error as it's the first line after a for loop.
    Line 4: Changed the range in the for loop from (6,11) to (10), adding a logical error.
