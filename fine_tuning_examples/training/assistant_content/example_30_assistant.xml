    Three syntax errors can quite easily be added to this program. There are two cases where the program has an equals sign combined with another operator. The order of these operators could be switched, a type of mistake that novice programmers commonly make, introducing a syntax error each (two in total). Finally, as novice programmers also struggle with correctly indenting programs very commonly, particularly in Python, one of the statements could be erroneously indented. The line with the while statement make most sense to indent, as this seems the most unobvious to debug.
    Two runtime errors could be added by replacing the assignment operators (=) in the two assignment statements in the program with equality operators (==). Novices typically get these two symbols confused, leading to runtime errors in Python. The other runtime error could be added by misspelling a variable reference, as novices often mistakenly believe that variable references don't have to be spelt the exact same. This could be done in the first print statement; to make it a bit more challenging to debug, both of instances of the word "total" could be capitalised.
    To add logical errors inkeeping with common novice mistakes, the final unindented line could be indented so that it's included in the logic of the while loop. The condition of the while loop could be changed to include a logically incorrect comparator â€“ 100 could be changed to 1000, making it a small subtle change.

        print("OVERLOAD! You have gone over 100!")

    Line 1: Replaced assignment operatos (=) with an equality operator (==) in the assignment, adding a NameError (an instance of a runtime error in Python) in this case.
    Line 2: Switched the ordering of the = and < on line 2, adding a syntax error.
    Line 2: Changed the right hand side value of the if statement condition from 100 to 1000, adding a logical error.
    Line 3: Replaced assignment operatos (=) with an equality operator (==) in the assignment, adding a NameError (an instance of a runtime error in Python) in this case.
    Line 4: Switched the ordering of the = and + on line 2, adding a syntax error.
    Line 5: Capitalised the reference to the total variable so that it no longer refers to a variable in the program, adding a NameError (an instance of a runtime error in Python).
    Line 7: Indented this line so that it executes within the while loop, adding a logical error.
