    Novice programmers often make lots of incorrect changes to small symbols, so a couple of these can be added in the clauses of the if statement to add some syntax errors. The same can be done to a print statement, perhaps by removing the brackets. Novices also get keywords confused sometimes, so the else clause could be changed to something different. Finally, some incorrect indentation can be added, as this is a construct that novices often don't get syntactically correct.
    A runtime error by capitalising one of the references to the number variable, as novices sometimes incorrectly capitalise variable references.

    <incorrect-program>
    number = int(input("Enter a number between 1 and 4: "))
    
    # Check the number and print the corresponding Spanish number
    if number == 1:
        print("You entered 1: Uno")
    elif number = 2:
        print("You entered 2: Dos")
    elif number == 3:
        print "You entered 3: Tres"
    elif Number == 4
        print("You entered 4: Cuatro")
    elif:
    print("That number is not valid.")

    Line 6: Replaced the equality operator (==) with an assignment operator (=) in the condition of the if statement, adding a syntax error in this case.
    Line 9: Removed the brackets from the print statement, adding a syntax error.
    Line 10: Removed the colon from the end of the elif clause on this line, adding a syntax error.
    Line 10: Capitalised the reference to the number variable on line 10 so it no longer refers to a variable in the program, adding a NameError (an instance of a runtime error in Python).
    Line 12: Renamed the "else" keyword to "elif", adding a syntax error.
    Line 13: Removed the necessary indentation for this line, adding a syntax error.
