    It's hard to add 12 syntax errors without significantly changing the program's structure, given the program is 8 lines long. A few common mistakes can be inserted nonetheless. Novice programmers often mismatch their brackets and write assignments and print statements incorrectly (syntactically). Therefore the square brackets on line 3 could be mismatched. The commas from the two print statements could be removed too. Finally, the terms in the assignment in line 5 could be swapped around, which would add a syntax error. This adds four syntax errors, which seems like a sensible amount given that three runtime errors need to be added.
    To add the runtime errors, there are plenty of errors regarding functions that could be added. One way of doing this is by capitalising some function calls and variable references. To make these errors more challenging to spot, this could be done on different lines. Line 5 could have the "int" function edited, while lines 6 and 8 could have the variable references capitalised.

    It's difficult to add 12 syntax errors without significantly changing the structure of the program, so only four were added.
    Line 3: Mismatched the square brackets for the list, adding a syntax error.
    Line 4: Removed the comma from the print statement, adding a syntax error.
    Line 5: Switched around the terms in the assignment, adding a syntax error.
    Line 5: Changed the call to the int() function to "to_int", adding a NameError (an instance of a runtime error in Python).
    Line 6: Changed the spelling of user_input to user_Input, meaning it no longer references an existing variable, adding a NameError (an instance of a runtime error in Python).
    Line 8: Removed the comma from the print statement, adding a syntax error.
    Line 8: Changed the spelling of random_list to random_List, meaning it no longer references an existing variable, adding a NameError (an instance of a runtime error in Python).
