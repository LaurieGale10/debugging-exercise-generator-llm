    It's hard to add 12 syntax errors without significantly changing the program's structure, given the program is 8 lines long. A few common mistakes can be inserted nonetheless. Novice programmers often mismatch their brackets and write assignments and print statements incorrectly (syntactically). Therefore the square brackets on line 3 could be mismatched. The commas from the two print statements could be removed too. Finally, the terms in the assignment in line 5 could be swapped around, which would add a syntax error. This adds four syntax errors, which seems like a sensible amount given that three runtime errors need to be added.
    To add the runtime errors, there are plenty of errors regarding functions that could be added. One way of doing this is by capitalising some function calls and variable references. To make these errors more challenging to spot, this could be done on different lines. Line 5 could have the "int" function edited, while lines 6 and 8 could have the variable references capitalised.

    to_int(input("Please enter an integer: ")) = user_input
    random_list.append(user_Input)

    It's difficult to add 12 syntax errors without significantly changing the structure of the program, so only four were added.
    Mismatched the square brackets on line 3.
    Switched around the terms in the assignment in line 5, introducing a syntax error.
    Changed the call to the int() function to "to_int", adding a runtime error.
    Removed the commas from the print statements on lines 4 and 8, each adding a syntax error.
    Misspelt references to the user_input and random_list variables on lines 6 and 8 respectively, each introducing runtime errors.
