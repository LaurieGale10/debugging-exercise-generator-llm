    Novice programmers have been found to confuse logical operators, which lead to logical errors. In this program, there are two logical operators which can be illogically changed on lines 7 and 12.

    country1 = input("Enter the name of the first country: ")
    country2 = input("Enter the name of the second country: ")
    
    country1 = country1.upper()
    country2 = country2.upper()
    
    if len(country1) > 4 and country1.startswith('Z'):
        shortened_country1 = country1[:2]
    else:
        shortened_country1 = country1[:3]
    
    if len(country2) > 4 and country2.startswith('Z'):
        shortened_country2 = country2[:2]
    else:
        shortened_country2 = country2[:3]
    
    print("Team 1: ", shortened_country1)
    print("Team 2: ", shortened_country2)

    Replaced the "or" operators on lines 7 and 12 with "and", adding a logical error.
