    To add two syntax errors, a couple of lines can be incorrectly indented, as introductory programmers often incorrectly indent parts of their programs.
    Since novices often use operations on values of incorrect types, the calls to the len() functions on lines 7 and 12 can be removed, raising a type error (an instance of a RuntimeError in Python) when line 7 is reached.
    Finally, a logical error can be added by removing a line that is required to fulfil the exercise description, such as one of the calls to the upper() function. Although research has not necessarily found novices to omit necessary code, this is a subtle error that will require students to think about the intended function of the program.

    <incorrect-program>
    country1 = input("Enter the name of the first country: ")
    country2 = input("Enter the name of the second country: ")
    
    country1 = country1.upper()
    
    if country1 > 4 or country1.startswith('Z'):
        shortened_country1 = country1[:2]
        else:
        shortened_country1 = country1[:3]
    
    if country2 > 4 or country2.startswith('Z'):
        shortened_country2 = country2[:2]
        else:
        shortened_country2 = country2[:3]
    
    print("Team 1: ", shortened_country1)
    print("Team 2: ", shortened_country2)
    </incorrect-program>

    <explanation>
    Removed line 5, which is required to display the country2 variable in uppercase.
    Incorrectly indented the else statements on lines 8 and 13.
    Removed the len() function calls from lines 6 and 11, each introducing type errors (instances of runtime errors in Python).
