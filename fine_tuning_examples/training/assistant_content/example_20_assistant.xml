    Novices typically mismatch brackets and other symbols when programming, so one of the lines could have unbalanced brackets.
    Removing the importing of the math library will introduce a NameError when any function from the math library is called, which is an instance of a runtime error.
    To add a logical error, since novices often get similar symbols confused, one of the mathematical operators in the assignment of the hypotenuse variable can be changed.

    <incorrect-program>
    opposite = float(input('Input the opposite side of a right angled triangle '))
    adjacent = float(input('Input the adjacent side of a right angled triangle )')
    
    hypotenuse = math.sqrt((opposite**2)-(adjacent**2))
    print(f'Given:  opposite = {opposite}, adjacent = {adjacent}')
    print(f'Result: hypotenuse = {hypotenuse}')
    </incorrect-program>

    Removed lines 1 and 2 of the original program

    4
    </error-location>
    
    <explanation>
    Line 1 of original program: Removed this import statement, causing a NameError (an instance of a runtime error in Python) when math.sqrt() is called in line 4.
    Line 2: Adjusted the bracketing of such that they are unbalanced, adding a syntax error.
    Line 4: Changed the add (+) operator a subtract (â€“) operator, adding a logical error.
