    This program is sufficiently large to add 12 errors to.
    Firstly, the while True loop could be removed from the program, adding a logical error and in the process adding syntax errors on the lines containing the break statements. Although novice programmers haven't necessarily been found to forget the inclusion of necessary iteration, this is a subtle enough error to be included in this debugging exercise.
    To add the remaining two syntax errors to the program, since novice programmers commonly confuse assignment (=) and equality (==) operators, the a couple of the equality operators in the conditions of the if statements can be switched.
    In the same way, the first two assignments on lines 2 and 3 can have their assignment operators switched, adding two runtime errors. Novice programmers also commonly mix up similar keywords, so the "input" keyword on line 6 can be misspelt, causing a NameError in Python. Finally, an int() cast can be added to line 10, since novice programmers often confuse string and integer types in Python.
    To add the remaining three logical errors, the other two conditions in the if statements can be illogically changed, again using the knowledge that novice programmers often confuse similar symbols with different semantics. Perhaps "==" can be changed to "!=", erroneously changing the flow of the program. Finally, one of the output statements can be illogically manipulated. This is not something that novice programmers have specifically been found to struggle with; it still seems like a challenging enough error to spot.

    Line 2: Replaced the assignment operator (=) with the equality operator (==) in this assignment, adding a NameError (an instance of a runtime error in Python) in this case.
    Line 3: Replaced the assignment operator (=) with the equality operator (==) in this assignment, adding a NameError (an instance of a runtime error in Python) in this case.
    Line 5 of original program: Removed the while True loop from line 5 of the original program, adding a logical error. This also causes syntax errors on lines 13 and 23 of the incorrect program (the break statements) to each add syntax errors.
    Line 6: Misspelt the call to the input function to intput(), which is not a valid function, adding a NameError (an instance of a runtime error in Python).
    Line 8: Replaced the equality operator (==) in the if statement condition with the assignment operator (=), adding a syntax error.
    Line 10: Added an int() cast to the right-hand side of the assignment, adding a TypeError (an instance of a runtime error in Python) in this case.
    Line 11: Changed the equality operator (==) to an inequality operator (!=), adding a logical error.
    Line 13: Since the while loop is removed, this break statement now causes a syntax error.
    Line 17: Replaced the equality operator (==) in the if statement condition with the assignment operator (=), adding a syntax error.
    Line 21: Changed the equality operator (==) to an inequality operator (!=), adding a logical error.
    Line 22: Changed the number 42 in the print statement to 22, adding a logical error.
    Line 23: Since the while loop is removed, this break statement now causes a syntax error.
