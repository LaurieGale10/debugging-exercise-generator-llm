    This program is sufficiently large to add 12 errors to.
    Firstly, the while True loop could be removed from the program, adding a logical error and in the process adding syntax errors on the lines containing the break statements. Although novice programmers haven't necessarily been found to forget the inclusion of necessary iteration, this is a subtle enough error to be included in this debugging exercise.
    To add the remaining two syntax errors to the program, since novice programmers commonly confuse assignment (=) and equality (==) operators, the a couple of the equality operators in the conditions of the if statements can be switched.
    In the same way, the first two assignments on lines 2 and 3 can have their assignment operators switched, adding two runtime errors. Novice programmers also commonly mix up similar keywords, so the "input" keyword on line 6 can be misspelt, causing a NameError in Python. Finally, an int() cast can be added to line 10, since novice programmers often confuse string and integer types in Python.
    To add the remaining three logical errors, the other two conditions in the if statements can be illogically changed, again using the knowledge that novice programmers often confuse similar symbols with different semantics. Perhaps "==" can be changed to "!=", erroneously changing the flow of the program. Finally, one of the output statements can be illogically manipulated. This is not something that novice programmers have specifically been found to struggle with; it still seems like a challenging enough error to spot.

    Replaced the assignment operator (=) with the equality operator (==) on lines 2 and 3, each adding a runtime error.
    Removed the while True loop from line 5 of the original program, adding a logical error and causing lines 13 and 23 of the incorrect program (the break statements) to each add syntax errors.
    Misspelt the call to the input function on line 6, adding a runtime error.
    Replaced the equality operator (==) with the assignment operator (=) on lines 8 and 17, each adding a syntax error.
    Added an int() cast to line 10, causing a runtime error.
    Changed the equality operators (==) on lines 11 and 21 to not equal operators (!=), each adding logical errors.
    Changed the number 42 to 22 in the print statement of line 22, adding a logical error.
