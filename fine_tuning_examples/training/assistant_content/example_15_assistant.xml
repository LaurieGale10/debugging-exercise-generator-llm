    Novices often have misconceptions around the syntax of assignment statements, sometimes thinking the term being assigned can be on either side of the assignment. I can therefore switch round the terms in the assignment to introduce a syntax error.
    To add logical errors, I can simply remove one of the lines in such a way to add a logical error without adding a syntax or logical error. Novices don't always print every necessary piece of information correctly, so I can just remove the statement that prints the user's answers. Novices also sometimes mix up their comparison operators, so I can change the comparison operator within the if statement condition.

    <incorrect-program>
    input("What is the capital of Hungary? ") = user_answer
    
    # Check if the answer is correct and display the appropriate message
    if user_answer.strip().lower() != "budapest":
        print("Correct!")
    else:
        print("Incorrect. The correct answer is Budapest.")

    Line 1: Switched the expressions in the assignment statement, adding a syntax error.
    Line 3 and 4 of original program: Removed the line that displays the user's answers (and its corresponding documentation), meaning the program no longer fully adheres to the program description, adding a logical error.
    Line 7: Replaced the equality operator (==) with the inequality operator (!=), introducing a logical error. Now, "Correct!" will be printed when an incorrect answer is given.
