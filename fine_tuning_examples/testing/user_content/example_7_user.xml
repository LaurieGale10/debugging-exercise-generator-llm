It's literacy week and the Head of English would like you to create a vowel checker program to ensure that year 7s are using plenty of vowels in their work.

- Let the user enter any sentence they like.
- For each letter in the sentence that they have just entered you need to use if statements to check if it is a vowel.
- After the for loop you need to print the number of vowels they have used.

<correct-program>
# Prompt the user to enter a sentence
sentence = input("Please enter a sentence: ").lower()

vowel_count = 0
vowels = "aeiou"

# Loop through each letter in the sentence
for letter in sentence:
    # Check if the letter is a vowel
    if letter in vowels:
        vowel_count += 1

print(f"The number of vowels in your sentence is: {vowel_count}")
</correct-program>
