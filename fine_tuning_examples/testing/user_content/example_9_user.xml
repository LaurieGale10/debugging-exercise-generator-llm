Write a program that inputs a year number and checks if it's a leap year. If it is, print LEAP, otherwise print COMMON.
- A year is a leap year if its number is exactly divisible by 4 and is not exactly divisible by 100.
- A year is always a leap year if its number is exactly divisible by 400.
Note that the words LEAP and COMMON should be printed all caps.

<correct-program>
# Input year number
year = int(input("Enter a year: "))

# Check if the year is a leap year
if (year % 4 == 0 and year % 100 != 0) or (year % 400 == 0):
    print("LEAP")
else:
    print("COMMON")
