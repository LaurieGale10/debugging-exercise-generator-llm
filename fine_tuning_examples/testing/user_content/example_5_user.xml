As a future athlete you just started your practice for an upcoming event. Given that on the first day you run 5 miles, and by the event you must be able to run 10 miles.
Calculate the number of days required for you to finally reach the required distance for the event, if you increases your distance each day by 10% from the previous day.

Print one integer representing the number of days to reach the required distance.

<correct-program>
current_distance = 5.0
required_distance = 10.0

# Initialise the day counter
days = 0

# Loop until the current distance reaches or exceeds the required distance
while current_distance < required_distance:
    # Increase the day counter
    days += 1
    # Increase the distance by 10%
    current_distance *= 1.1
print("The number of days required to train is",days)
