A school is organising a trip to a theme park. The coaches they are hiring can fit 45 people.

Enter the total number of people going on the trip and work out how many coaches will be full (using integer division) and how many people will be left over on a partly full coach (using modulo division).

coach_capacity = 45

total_people = int(input("Enter the total number of people going on the trip: "))
full_coaches = total_people // coach_capacity
leftover_people = total_people % coach_capacity

# Print the results
print("Number of full coaches needed:",full_coaches)
print("Number of people on the partly full coach:",leftover_people)
