    Two syntax errors can easily be added to this program, so best to make them subtle. Since novice programmers often confuse the assignment operator (=) with the equality operator (==), one of the equality operators on line 5 can be replaced with an assignment, which adds a syntax error in Python. Second, the "else" keyword can be changed to "elif", as novice programmers often confuse keywords of similar spellings.

    # Input year number
    year = int(input("Enter a year: "))
    
    # Check if the year is a leap year
    if (year % 4 = 0 and year % 100 != 0) or (year % 400 = 0):
        print("LEAP")
    elif:
        print("COMMON")

    Replaced the = after "year % 4" on line 5 with a ==.
    Changed the "else" keyword to "elif" on line 7.
