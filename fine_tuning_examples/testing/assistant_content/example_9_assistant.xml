    Two syntax errors can easily be added to this program, so best to make them subtle. Since novice programmers often confuse the assignment operator (=) with the equality operator (==), one of the equality operators on line 5 can be replaced with an assignment, which adds a syntax error in Python. Second, the "else" keyword can be changed to "elif", as novice programmers often confuse keywords of similar spellings.

    # Input year number

    if (year % 4 = 0 and year % 100 != 0) or (year % 400 == 0):
        print("LEAP")
    elif:
        print("COMMON")

    Line 5: Replaced the equality operator (==) with an assignment operator (=) in the first if statement condition, adding a syntax error in this case.
    Line 7: Changed the "else" keyword to "elif", adding a syntax error.
