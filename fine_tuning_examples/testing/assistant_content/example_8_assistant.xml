    Because novice programmers often mistmatch brackets, one of the closing parentheses in one of the input statements can be changed to a different type of bracket. A colon at the end of one of the selection or iteration constructs can also be removed, as this is something novice programmers typically forget to add.
    Novice programmers often struggle with indentation, specifically ensuring loops are repeated the correct number of times.
    Both the terms in the for loops can therefore be illogically manipulated. Similarly, both of the print statements can be changed to output the incorrect expressions.
    To add the last logical error, the inequality in line 5 can be changed to add a logical error in such a way that no runtime or syntax error is added. This is inkeeping with common novice mistakes when programming, as they often mix up similar symbols.

    # Input integers A and B
    A = int(input("Enter the first integer (A): "))
    B = int(input("Enter the second integer (B): ")))
    
    if A =< B:
        for i in range(A, B):
            print(A, end=' ')
    else:
        for i in range(A, B, -1):

    Replaced the closing bracket on line 3 with a square bracket.
    Removed the colon at the end of line 5.
    Changed the ranges in the for loops on lines 6 and 8, both adding logical errors.
    Changed both print statements to print the variables A and B rather than the numbers between them.
