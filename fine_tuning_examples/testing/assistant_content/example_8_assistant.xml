    Because novice programmers often mistmatch brackets, one of the closing parentheses in one of the input statements can be changed to a different type of bracket. A colon at the end of one of the selection or iteration constructs can also be removed, as this is something novice programmers typically forget to add.
    Novice programmers often struggle with indentation, specifically ensuring loops are repeated the correct number of times.
    Both the terms in the for loops can therefore be illogically manipulated. Similarly, both of the print statements can be changed to output the incorrect expressions.
    To add the last logical error, the inequality in line 5 can be changed to add a logical error in such a way that no runtime or syntax error is added. This is inkeeping with common novice mistakes when programming, as they often mix up similar symbols.

    Line 3: Replaced the closing bracket at the end of the line with a square bracket, adding a syntax error
    Line 5: Removed the colon at the end of line 5, adding a syntax error.
    Line 5: Replaced the less than equality (<) with a less than or equal equality (<=), adding a logical error (the wrong branch of the if statement will be called for when A == B).
    Line 6: Changed the stop parameter in the for loop from B + 1 to B, adding a logical error.
    Line 7: Changed the output of the print statement to be A rather than i, adding a logical error.
    Line 9: Changed the stop parameter in the for loop from B - 1 to B, adding a logical error.
    Line 10: Changed the output of the print statement to be B rather than i, adding a logical error.
