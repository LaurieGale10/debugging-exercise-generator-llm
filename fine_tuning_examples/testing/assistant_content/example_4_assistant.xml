    One runtime could be added by replacing an assignment operator (=) with an equality operator (==), which is something that novice programmers have been found to commonly do. Line 1 could also be removed, causing runtime errors whenever a function from the random library is imported. Although research hasn't found this to be a common mistake, it is still a sufficiently challenging error.
    Novices often make errors relating to loops. Some common examples include leaving necessary statements outside of loops and not iterating the correct number of times. Both of these errors could easily be added to this program; line 4 can be unindented and the range in line 2 can be changed. Then, the numbers variable can be printed instead of the selected_number variable.

    for i in range(5):
        num = float(input(f"Enter number {i + 1}: "))
    numbers.append(num)
    
    selected_number == random.choice(numbers)
    
    print("Randomly selected number: "+numbers)

    Line 1 of original program: Removed the import statement, adding a NameError (an instance of a runtime error in Python) whenever a call to the random library is made.
    Line 2: Changed the range in the for loop so it iterates five times instead of four, adding a logical error.
    Line 4: Unindented this line so it's no longer executed within the for loop, adding a logical error.
    Line 6: Replaced the assignment operator (=) with an equality operator (==) in the assignment, adding a NameError (an instance of a runtime error in Python) in this case.
    Line 8: Changed the variable reference in the print statement from selected_number to number, meaning the incorrect variable is printed, adding a logical error.
