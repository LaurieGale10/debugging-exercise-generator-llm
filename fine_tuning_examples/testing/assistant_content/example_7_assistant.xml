    There are several constructs that novice programmers often get syntactically incorrect where syntax errors could be added: use of quotation marks and brackets, indentation, and reserved words. So the quotation marks could be removed from line 4, and the "in" keyword could be syntactically misspelt. Line 10 could be unindented and one of the brackets in the print statements in line 12 could be removed.
    Novice programmers often get assignment operators (=) and equality operators confused (==), so the assignments on lines 3 and 4 could have =='s added to them to add the two runtime errors.
    Logical errors could be added relating to the vowel_count variable. Since novice programmers often get similar symbols confused, the + in line 10 could be removed. Novices also get logical operators mixed up, so a "not" could be added to line 9 to add a logical error. Although not a common novice mistake, the vowel_count variable could be incorrectly assigned on line 3 to provide a final logical error.

    Replaced assignment operators (=) with equality operators (==), adding two runtime errors.
    Incorrectly assigned the vowel_count variable to 10 instead of 0.
    Removed the quotation marks from line 4, adding a syntax error.
    Added a "not" operator to line 9, adding a logical error. Also misspelt the "in" keyword, adding a syntax error.
    Unindented line 10.
    Removed the closing } from the print statement in line 12.
