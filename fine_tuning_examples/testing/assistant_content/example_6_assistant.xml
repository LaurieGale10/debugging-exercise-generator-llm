    Functions are threshold concepts for novice programmers. One common mistake in Python is to forget the colon required at the end of the function definition, so this can be removed to add a syntax error.
    To add runtime errors, since novices also struggle to understand the need for type casts, the float() cast on line 6 can be removed to add a type error (instance of runtime error in Python). Novice programmers also often incorrectly spell variable references, which typically lead to runtime errors in Python. Both variable references can be misspelt in line 12 to add the remaining two runtime errors.

    # Define a function to calculate and return the area of a square
    def calculate_square_area(side_length)
        return side_length * side_length
    
    # Ask the user to input the length of a side in a square
    side_length = input("Enter the length of a side in the square: ")
    
    # Call the function to calculate the area of the square
    area = calculate_square_area(side_length)
    
    # Print the calculated area
    print("The area of the square with side length "+str(Side_Length)+" is: "+str(Area))

    Line 2: Removed the colon at the end of the function definition, adding a syntax error.
    Line 12: Changed the spelling of the side_length variable reference to Side_Length which does not exist in the program, adding a NameError (an instance of a runtime error in Python).
    Line 12: Changed the spelling of the area variable reference to Area which does not exist in the program, adding a NameError (an instance of a runtime error in Python).
