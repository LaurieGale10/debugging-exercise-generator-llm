    Functions are threshold concepts for novice programmers. One common mistake in Python is to forget the colon required at the end of the function definition, so this can be removed to add a syntax error.
    To add runtime errors, since novices also struggle to understand the need for type casts, the float() cast on line 6 can be removed to add a type error (instance of runtime error in Python). Novice programmers also often incorrectly spell variable references, which typically lead to runtime errors in Python. Both variable references can be misspelt in line 12 to add the remaining two runtime errors.

    <incorrect-program>
    # Define a function to calculate and return the area of a square
    def calculate_square_area(side_length)
        return side_length * side_length
    
    # Ask the user to input the length of a side in a square
    side_length = input("Enter the length of a side in the square: ")
    
    # Call the function to calculate the area of the square
    area = calculate_square_area(side_length)
    
    # Print the calculated area
    print("The area of the square with side length "+str(Side_Length)+" is: "+str(Area))

    <explanation>
    Removed the colon required at the end of line 2
    Adjusted the spelling of the variable references in line 12 to non-existent variables, both raising NameErrors (types of runtime error in Python).
