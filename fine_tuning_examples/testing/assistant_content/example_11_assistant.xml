    There's lots of places a runtime error can be added to this program. Since novices often slightly misspell variable names and function calls, one of these in the program can be misspelt.
    To add one of the logical errors, since novice programmers implement iteration that repeats an incorrect number of times, the right-hand side of the while loop can be adjusted to be logically incorrect. Novices also sometimes struggle to correctly format print statements, so the final print statement could be altered to print the string "players[0]" instead of the variable. This adds a logical error without adding a syntax or runtime error.

    <explanation>
    Line 8: Replaced the 100 in the if statement condition with 101, adding a logical error in the case when a user inputs 101.
    Line 16: Replaced the 1 on the right-hand side of the while loop condition with a 0, adding a logical error.
    Line 28: Removed the curly braces surrounding the players variable reference, meaning the string literal "players[0]" is printed rather than anything else introducing a logical error.
