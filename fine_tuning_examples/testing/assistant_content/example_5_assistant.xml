    Syntax errors can be added in lots of places in this program. Firstly, novice programmers have been found to miss colons at the end of selection and iteration in Python, so the colon at the end of line 8 can be removed. They also sometimes get the syntax of assignment statements incorrect, so the first two assignments can be manipulated to be syntactically incorrect.
    To add runtime errors, since novice programmers have been found to misspell variable names (which leads to a runtime variable in Python), the two references to the days variable can be misspelt. The type of the value on line 10 can be changed to a string to introduce a type error, as novices also struggle to correctly convert between int and string types in Python.
    Novice programmers often get symbols confused, so the inequality in line 8 can be changed such that a logical error is added. Similarly, the * operator in line 12 can be changed to be logically incorrect.

    current_distance "=" 5.0

    # Initialise the day counter
    days = 0
    
    # Loop until the current distance reaches or exceeds the required distance
    while current_distance > required_distance
        # Increase the day counter
        Days += "1"
        # Increase the distance by 10%
        current_distance += 1.1
    print("The number of days required to train is",Days)

    Line 1: Enclosed the assignment operator (=) in quotation marks, adding syntax errors.
    Line 2: Enclosed the assignment operator (=) in quotation marks, adding syntax errors.
    Line 8: Replaced the less than inequality (<) with a greater than inequality (>) in line 8, adding a logical error.
    Line 10: Capitalised the reference to the days variable so that it no longer refers to a valid variable, adding a NameError (an instance of a runtime error in Python).
    Line 10: Encapsulated the 1 in quotation marks so it's a string instead of an int, adding a TypeError (an instance of a runtime error in Python).
    Line 12: Changed the multiplication operator (*) to an addition operator (+), adding a logical error.
    Line 13: Capitalised the reference to the days variable so that it no longer refers to a valid variable, adding a NameError (an instance of a runtime error in Python).
