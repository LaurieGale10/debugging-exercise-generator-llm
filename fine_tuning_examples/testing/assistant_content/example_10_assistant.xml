    This program seems large enough to add 15 errors to as it's 35 lines. To make the program remain consistent, the same sort of error can be added in several locations.
    Novice programmers often confuse similar quotation marks in print statements, raising syntax errors. This can be done in lines 4 and 7. Since they also struggle with indenting programming constructs correctly in Python, else/elif's can be incorrectly indented, adding three syntax errors.
    Novices often confuse assignment (=) and equality operators (==). Replacing an = with a == adds a NameError in Python (an instance of a runtime error), so this can be done on lines 6 and 28. The int() cast on line 10 can also be removed to cause a TypeError (another instance of a runtime error in Python). Finally, since novice programmers often misunderstand the necessity to spell function calls correctly, the two calls to external library functions can be capitalised, causing two more runtime errors.
    Novice programmers typically make logical mistakes in relation to the conditions of if statements and for loops. Therefore, the conditions on lines 9 and 31 can be changed to be logically incorrect. Line 28 may seem confusing to a novice programmer, so this can be changed to be logically incorrect, allowing them to work out a solution that is appropriate to their level of understanding. Similarly, the parameters to the random.sample() function call can be changed to be logically incorrect.

    Replaced the quotation mark with two different quotation marks on lines 4 and 7.
    Replaced the assignment operator (=) with an equality operator (==) on lines 6 and 28.
    Replaced the 5 with a 6 on line 9, adding a logical error.
    Removed the int() cast from line 10, adding a runtime error.
    Incorrectly indented lines 13, 15, and 33.
    Capitalised the calls to external library functions on lines 19 and 24, both adding runtime errors.
    Changed two of the parameters inside the random.sample() function (21 to 20 and 5 to 6), each adding logical errors.
    Changed the equality operator (==) to an inequality operator (!=) on line 32, adding a logical error.
