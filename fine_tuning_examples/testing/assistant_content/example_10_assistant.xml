    This program seems large enough to add 15 errors to as it's 35 lines. To make the program remain consistent, the same sort of error can be added in several locations.
    Novice programmers often confuse similar quotation marks in print statements, raising syntax errors. This can be done in lines 4 and 7. Since they also struggle with indenting programming constructs correctly in Python, else/elif's can be incorrectly indented, adding three syntax errors.
    Novices often confuse assignment (=) and equality operators (==). Replacing an = with a == adds a NameError in Python (an instance of a runtime error), so this can be done on lines 6 and 28. The int() cast on line 10 can also be removed to cause a TypeError (another instance of a runtime error in Python). Finally, since novice programmers often misunderstand the necessity to spell function calls correctly, the two calls to external library functions can be capitalised, causing two more runtime errors.
    Novice programmers typically make logical mistakes in relation to the conditions of if statements and for loops. Therefore, the conditions on lines 9 and 31 can be changed to be logically incorrect. Line 28 may seem confusing to a novice programmer, so this can be changed to be logically incorrect, allowing them to work out a solution that is appropriate to their level of understanding. Similarly, the parameters to the random.sample() function call can be changed to be logically incorrect.

    Line 4: Replaced the opening quotation mark with two different quotation marks so they don't match, adding a syntax error.
    Line 6: Replaced the assignment operator (=) with an equality operator (==) in the assignment, adding a NameError (an instance of a runtime error in Python) in this case.
    Line 7: Added another opening quotation mark with two different quotation marks so they don't match, adding a syntax error.
    Line 9: Replaced the 5 on the right hand side of while loop comparison with a 6, adding a logical error as the loop repeats one too many times.
    Line 10: Removed the int() cast from the right-hand side of the assignment, adding a TypeError (an instance of a runtime error in Python) in this case.
    Line 13: Incorrectly indented this line, adding a syntax error.
    Line 15: Incorrectly indented this line, adding a syntax error.
    Line 19: Capitalised the call to the random.sample() function so it no longer refers to a valid function, adding a NameError (an instance of a runtime error in Python) in this case.
    Line 19: Changed the stop parameter inside the range() function from 21 to 20, adding a logical error.
    Line 19: Changed the k parameter inside the random.sample() function from 5 to 6, adding a logical error.
    Line 24: Capitalised the call to the time.sleep() function so it no longer refers to a valid function, adding a NameError (an instance of a runtime error in Python) in this case.
    Line 28: Replaced the assignment operator (=) with an equality operator (==) in the assignment, adding a NameError (an instance of a runtime error in Python) in this case.
    Line 28: Changed the right-hand side of assignment to be the sum of user_numbers and lottery_numbers, adding a logical error.
    Line 31: Replaced the equality operator (==) with an inequality operator (!=) in the condition of the while loop, adding a logical error.
    Line 33: Incorrectly indented this line, adding a syntax error.
