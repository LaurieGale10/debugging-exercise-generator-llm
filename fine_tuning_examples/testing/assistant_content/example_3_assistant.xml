    It's difficult to add eight syntax errors without significantly changing the structure of the program, but four seems like a sensible number to add. First, novice programmers often capitalise keywords that shouldn't be, so the "import" keyword could be capitalised to add a syntax error. Additionally, all of the assignments could have their terms switched around, as this adds three syntax errors in a way that novice programmers usually program. Finally, since novices also often incorrectly indent their code, one of the lines could be indented.
    Runtime errors could easily be added. Novice programmers sometimes misspell function names, so the sqrt functions could be misspelt which causes runtime errors. Novices also get confused over the notion of int and str types in Python, so the int() cast on line 3 could be removed, causing a type error (a type of runtime error in Python).
    Similar to other errors added, a logical error could be added by removing the "f" token inside the print statement in line 7. This will stop the variables from being printed in the program's output, adding a logical error.

    It's difficult to add so many errors to this program without significantly changing its structure, so only four syntax errors were added.
    Line 1: Capitalised the "import" keyword, adding a syntax error in this case.
    Line 3: Removed the int() cast from this line, adding a TypeError (an instance of a runtime error in Python).
    Line 3: Switched the terms in the assignment around, adding a syntax error.
    Line 4: Switched the terms in the assignment around, adding a syntax error.
    Line 4: Changed the calls to the sqrt() function to read square_root() instead, adding a NameError (an instance of a runtime error in Python).
    Line 5: Switched the terms in the assignment around, adding a syntax error.
    Line 5: Changed the calls to the sqrt() function to read square_root() instead, adding a NameError (an instance of a runtime error in Python).
    Line 7: Removed the "f" from the print statement, meaning the variable values are no longer printed, adding a logical error.
